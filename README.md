#  Miz - Movie Recommender System

This is a web-based  Miz - Movie Recommender System that suggests 5 movies to the user based on their preferences. The system is built using HTML, CSS, Flask, and incorporates machine learning techniques to provide accurate recommendations. The dataset used for this project is sourced from TMDB (The Movie Database).

## Features

- User-friendly web interface
- Suggests 5 movies based on user input
- Utilizes TMDB datasets for movie information
- Machine learning algorithms for recommendations
- Developed using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project is from TMDB (The Movie Database). The dataset includes various attributes about movies, such as title, genre, ratings, and more. This data is used to train the machine learning model and provide recommendations.

## Machine Learning Model

The recommender system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies. The model is trained on the TMDB dataset to learn patterns and preferences based on user input. The recommendation engine processes the user's preferences and generates a list of 5 movies that match the user's taste.
